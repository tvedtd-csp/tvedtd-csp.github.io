<h2>All About Lola</h2>
<p>This is Lola, the bestest lil’ pup in the world. A biased opinion you might think, well, maybe just a smidge. Lola is a red and white, eleven-year-old shih tzu. Don’t let the mustache fool you now, this pup is a girl. Lola loves people, high-fashion, riding in cars, good food, and napping. She could be mistaken for a second shadow at times. This little pup loves to go everywhere and do everything her human family are doing.</p>
