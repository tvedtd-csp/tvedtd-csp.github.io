<p>Dogs and fashion may not seem like they go together but surprisingly they can. Dog clothes are not only cute and fun but can be functionable too. At first one may not see how, but Lola has environmental allergies which in turn for dogs means one of the reactions is that they scratch at their skin and can create a hotspot-sore on their skin. Clothes provide a protective barrier between the scratching and skin. So, a pup in clothes can be a good thing. In addition to an everyday array of shirts there are special occasion outfits as well. Can’t forget the Halloween costumes, cute Christmas wear or an Easter dress. All of Lola’s outfits could fill a small pup closet!</p>
