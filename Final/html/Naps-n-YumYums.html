<h2>Naps and Yum Yums</h2>
<p>Lola, like most dogs loves to take naps. If there is no action going on, she will make herself comfortable and plop down anywhere near her humans are. Only on the rare occasion will Lola sleep under blankets. She prefers to sleep on top of the covers not under them. Pillows are choice sleeping places for her as she is a pup who loves and seems to demand comfort.</p>

<p>Dogs love food and Lola is no exception to that rule. A true foodie at heart. She is fed a homecooked diet prepared especially for her by her human mom. Lola is not a child, but at times she is babied just like a real child by her members of her family. Pig ears are one of her favorite treats. Starbucks is a favorite of her human family members, and occasionally she gets a little Starbucks cream treat too. She loves nibbles of stinky liver and kidney. Hey, if itâ€™s food, then she will happily and eagerly gobble it up in the blink of an eye. This pup never says no to a tasty treat.</p>
