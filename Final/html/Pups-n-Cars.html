<h3>Pup in Cars</h2>
</div>
<p>Lola loves to take car rides. It is not unusual for her to run up to the passenger side of a car, sometimes even stranger’s cars, and just wait to get inside. Even though she is a senior pup in dog years, she still can’t drive. Such a bummer for her since it’s a human thing after all. Lola doesn’t mind sitting behind the wheel and pretending to drive any chance she gets. Car rides are a fun activity for her.</p>
